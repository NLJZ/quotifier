# Quotifier/notes and quotes

# About:

This app will make your research and writing way easier, faster and organised. Are you writing an article? A paper? A book? Whatever the format is, this app will help you record, store, and find back all your notes and quotes, making quoting way faster and more effective.

# How it works:

1. Find your quotes wherever (books, articles, internet…)
2. Copy-paste them if they are coming from a digital pdf and paste them in the app
3. Photograph texts from physical books
4. Assign any useful category to the quote
5. Assign requested categories such as author, year, edition, publisher
6. When the article is structured and you know which topics you are working with, you can find your quotes back by clicking on the relevant tags.

# Benefits:

- Effective and faster work for writers, researchers, or anyone wanting to store their favourite quotes
- Reusable quotes for any new project
- a way to brainstorm and develop new ideas and connections
- Create projects and reuse

# Examples:

The potential user has to write an article for a magazine, for example. He/she needs to research and compile quotes first and make some notes prior to starting with the actual writing. Later on, after having organised the text structure and the topics to write about, he/she needs to get back to his notes and quotes. But they are a mess! Where to find that very key note among all? There was something relevant to a topic but he can&#39;t remember exactly what it was and how to find it.

This is a very recurrent situation when compiling notes and quotes. After a while you don&#39;t know anymore where they are or how to find them.

With _Quotify,_ the user can easily reach back any relevant note or quote, by clicking on tags related to topics, authors, publishers, etc…(some criterias are preset by the app and others are made by the user).

During the preliminary research period the user would store notes and quotes in the app and record mandatory criteria like author, date, edition, publisher and page, and other optional criteria, like topics (nature, philosophy, dadaism, politics, posthumanism, theatre, etc..etc...)

When the time comes for writing the article, the user can log into the account. All the categories that were recorded will appear on his/her profile page and he/she can search whatever he/she needs by clicking on a set of criterias. Then the quotes will appear, accompanied by all the relevant information (author, year, etc...)
